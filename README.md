## Getting Started

*  Create a new GitHub repo called unit-4-game, then clone it to your computer.
*  Inside the unit-4-game folder, create an index.html file.
*  Still inside the unit-4-game directory, make a folder called assets.
*  Inside the assets directory, make three additional folders: javascript, css and images.
*  In the javascript folder, make a file called game.js.
*  In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
*  In the css folder, make a file called reset.css. Paste into it the code found from the Meyerweb Reset.
*  In the images folder, save any of the images you plan on using.
*  Set up your repository to deploy to Github Pages.
*  Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Game Function
*  The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will     guess with numbers instead of letters. 
*  There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
*  The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
*  When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total        score. 
*  Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
*  When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
*  The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
*  The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
*  The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
*  When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will        have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
*  The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the        page as a means to restart the game.
*  The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
*  Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
